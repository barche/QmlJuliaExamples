# QmlJuliaExamples

These are examples for use with the [QML.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/QML.jl) package. To run them, clone this repository and `cd ` to one of its subdirectories. Then run `julia --project` and [instantiate the environment](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project).

Quickstart to test, from within Julia:

```julia
# Alternatively, execute the git command directly in the shell or download the zip file
import LibGit2
isdir("QmlJuliaExamples") || LibGit2.clone("https://github.com/barche/QmlJuliaExamples.git", "QmlJuliaExamples")
cd("QmlJuliaExamples/basic") # or images, opengl or plots instead of the basic subdirectory

# As an alternative to next three lines,
# 1) Start Julia with `julia --project`
# 2) Run `instantiate` from the pkg shell.
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()

readdir() # Print list of example files
include("gui.jl") # Or any of the files in the directory
```
Most of the examples consist of a Julia script and a .qml file in the qml subfolder.

The qml file defines how the GUI looks, the Julia script provides one or more functions
for the business logic.

You will find the line:
```julia
ENV["QSG_RENDER_LOOP"] = "basic"
```
on top of most scripts to disable QML multithreading which is not yet supported by QML 0.9.
